# Playground for Various Simple Optimization Problems

In this repository, I will be uploading solutions for basic `linear and non-linear optimization problems` that I have worked on for developing a better understanding of *Discrete Optimization* and various *Operations Research* problems in general. The solutions will be implemented using `MS Excel (Solver Add-In)` and `Python (using PuLP, Pyomo, or SciPy)`

* [Office Assignment Optimization Problem](office-assignment-optimization)
* [Knapsack Problem](knapsack-problem)
